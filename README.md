# WIP

This is a bot that automatically hosts rooms and calculates ratings using a statistical rating algorithm. Currently, most functionality hasn't been implemented yet.

Discord commands and config files are used to easily open rooms according to specific settings. Salama's host and playlist mods are loaded by the bot to extend its functionality.

# License

Most of the code and dependencies are licensed under MIT with the only exception being the code injector which is licensed under GPL. So the combined project is licensed under GPL.
