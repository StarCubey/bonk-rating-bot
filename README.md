This is a bot that automatically hosts rooms and calculates ratings using a statistical rating algorithm. Currently, most functionality hasn't been implemented yet.

Discord commands and config files are used to easily open rooms according to specific settings. The bot loads the sgrAPI mod on room creation in order to simplify room hosting automation.
